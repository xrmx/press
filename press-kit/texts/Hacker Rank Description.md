Coding Gym is an international programming lab format open to any language developed for continuous improvement. 
Coding Gym's manifesto follows:

"We help others practice programming, software development and communication skills by making coding laboratories open to any programming language where cooperation is valued over competition, doing and sharing are valued over teaching, and where competing solutions come with discussing and understanding tradeoffs."

<strong>This is not a contest:</strong> Coding Gym is collaborative, this contest is just like a challenge container.
